BackTracking is Recursion to generate all combinations and print them
we go until the point where we can go and no condition is getting voilated and answer can be obtained otherwise we stop there and Backtrack to all other solutions and find the answer
DFS + not visiting an invalid node = Backtracking
DFS + not visiting node twice = Dynamic Programming
Example -
You are concerned with what the actual solutions are rather than say the most optimum value of some parameter. (if it were the latter itâ€™s most likely DP or greedy).  
Imagine all the subset possible for your array. [1,1,2,5,3,4]  
Backtracking will ask you how many ways you can add these numbers to sum of 5. ie [1,4], [1,4], [2,3], [5]  
DP problem will ask you like the optimal answer. Like what's the least number of digits you can use to have sum of 5. ie [5] so answer is 1 digit.  
Do you see the difference? One ask you basically " what the actual solutions" is while other is asking you "say the most optimum value of some parameter".  
DP problems in these kind of question will ask you a some min/max/best/least out of your subset where as backtracking will ask all the way possible ways
