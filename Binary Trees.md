- [ ] Concepts
	- [ ] Complete Binary Tree 
		- [ ] Every Level has 2 nodes except the last level where the nodes are left as much as possible
		- [ ] A complete binary tree is said to be a proper binary tree where all leaves have the same depth.
		- [ ] In a complete binary tree number of nodes at depth ****d**** is ****2********d****. 
		- [ ] In a  complete binary tree with ****n**** nodes height of the tree is ****log(n+1)****.
		- [ ] All the levels ****except the last level**** are completely full.
	
	- [ ] Perfect Binary Tree 
		- [ ] A binary tree of height ‘h’ having the maximum number of nodes is a ****perfect**** binary tree.   
		- [ ] For a given height ****h****, the maximum number of nodes is ****2********h+1********-1****.
		- [ ] A ****complete**** binary tree of height h is a perfect binary tree up to height ****h-1****, and in the last level element are stored in left to right order.
	
	- [ ] Full Tree
		- [ ] For a full binary tree, every node has either 2 children or 0 children.
		- [ ] ![[Pasted image 20231015182013.png]]
		- [ ] In the given binary tree there is no node having degree 1, either 2 or 0 children for every node, hence it is ****a full binary tree****.
